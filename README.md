The Weeknd Event Center created by Olha Spiro

I have created 5 HTML and 5 CSS files: Home, Events, Menu, Location and Contact pages, naming them accordingly. All 5 pages have a navigation bar with links for each other, and a footer. 
I styled the form for usability and visual consistency using CSS.
I ensured the design adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes by using media queries for my CSS files.


My Home Page includes: a banner ("the-weeknd.jpg"), a navigation bar, a welcome message, About Us section, and a footer.

I used semantic elements (article & section) to structure the Events Page. I included three images and descriptions for them.
For styling I added hover effects with a color change on the text.

For the Menu Page I created a table to display the food menu. I added four category headers: Appetizers, Mains, Desserts, Drinks with their names and price. As a bonus I added hover effects on the category rows. 

For the Location Page I embeded a Google Map with the address. I included hours of operation. I used CSS to center content.

Finally, for the Contact Page I built a form with the Name,
Email, Message fields, and a Submit button. I applied CSS effects (cursor:poiner and hover effect) for the button.
